Here are three fundamental data types in Python:\n","\n","**Integer (int):** The integer data type represents whole numbers without any decimal points. It can be positive or negative. For example: 0, 10, -5. Integers can be used for arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n","\n","**String (str):** The string data type represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks. It is used to store textual data. Strings can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. For example: \"Hello, World!\", 'Python', \"123\". Strings in Python are immutable, which means they cannot be changed once created, but new strings can be created by concatenation or other string manipulation operations.\n","\n","**Boolean (bool):** The boolean data type represents a logical value that can be either True or False. Booleans are often used in conditions and control flow statements to make decisions or evaluate expressions. They are useful for determining the truth or falsity of a statement.

It represents a computation or a value that can be evaluated to produce a result.\n","\n","*   In an expression, operators are symbols that perform specific operations on operands. Examples of operators include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=), logical operators (and, or, not), and more.\n","*   Operands are the values or variables on which the operators act. They can be literals, such as numbers or strings, or variables that hold values.\n","*   Expressions are used in programming to perform calculations, make comparisons, evaluate conditions, and manipulate data. They can be used in assignments to assign a value to a variable, in control flow statements to make decisions based on certain conditions, or in function calls to pass arguments and compute return values.\n","*   When an expression is evaluated, it produces a result based on the operators and operands involved. The result can be of various types, depending on the expression and the operations performed. For example, an arithmetic expression may evaluate to a numeric value, a comparison expression may evaluate to a boolean value (True or False), and so on.\n","\n","Overall, expressions in programming are fundamental building blocks that allow for computations and decision-making within a program.

It represents a computation and returns a result. Expressions can be as simple as a single value or as complex as a combination of multiple operations. Examples of expressions include mathematical calculations like 2 + 3, string concatenation like \"Hello, \" + name, or function calls like len(my_list). **Expressions can be used within statements to perform computations, assign values, or make comparisons.**\n","*   **Statement:** A statement is a complete instruction or action that performs a specific operation or control flow within a program. It represents a command or directive to the computer. Statements can be simple or compound. Simple statements perform a single action, such as assigning a value to a variable (spam = 10) or calling a function. Compound statements consist of multiple simpler statements grouped together, such as loops and conditional statements. Examples of compound statements include if-else statements, while loops, and function definitions. **Statements are executed sequentially in a program and can alter the program's state or control the flow of execution.**\n","\n","The key difference between expressions and statements is their purpose and behavior. **Expressions compute values and can be used within statements**, while **statements represent instructions or actions that control program execution and alter the program's state**."],"metadata":{"id":"4WvmClKgeWAj"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question 6**: After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n","\n","bacon = 22\n","\n","bacon + 1"],"metadata":{"id":"50tPH05f33WZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["After running the following code, variable bacon will contain **23**"],"metadata":{"id":"4h3F936af_cn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question 7**: What should the values of the following two terms be?\n","\n","'spam' + 'spamspam'\n","\n","'spam' * 3"],"metadata":{"id":"X6MoHwJ333g0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["*   'spam' + 'spamspam' = spamspamspam\n","*   'spam' * 3 = spamspamspam"],"metadata":{"id":"l93oPEJ9go_7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question 8**: Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?"],"metadata":{"id":"BSVwpkTk33oh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Variable should not be started with number"],"metadata":{"id":"n3UmxC3EhGye"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question 9**: What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?"],"metadata":{"id":"hGfcK6y_33zk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In Python, we can use the following three functions to convert a value to different data types:\n","\n","**int():** This function is used to convert a value to an integer data type.
