Here are the common log levels and their appropriate use cases:\n","\n","**DEBUG:** The DEBUG log level is used for detailed information useful for debugging purposes. It is typically used during development and is disabled in production environments. Examples of DEBUG log messages include variable values, function calls, and other detailed diagnostic information.\n","\n","**INFO:** The INFO log level is used to provide informational messages about the program's execution. These messages are generally used to indicate the progress of the program or important events. Examples of INFO log messages include startup messages, successful operations, or high-level status updates.\n","\n","**WARNING:** The WARNING log level is used to indicate potential issues or situations that could lead to errors or unexpected behavior. These messages highlight conditions that may require attention but don't necessarily indicate a failure. Examples of WARNING log messages include deprecated function usage, non-critical exceptions, or configuration warnings.\n","\n","**ERROR:** The ERROR log level is used to indicate errors or exceptional conditions that have occurred during the program's execution. These messages highlight failures or unexpected situations that may impact the program's functionality. Examples of ERROR log messages include handled exceptions, failed operations, or critical errors that need attention.\n","\n","**CRITICAL:** The CRITICAL log level is used to indicate critical errors or severe failures that may result in the termination of the program or significant loss of functionality. These messages represent the most severe level of log messages. Examples of CRITICAL log messages include unrecoverable errors, system failures, or critical security breaches.\n","\n","By setting the appropriate log level, developers can control the amount of information logged and focus on the relevant log messages based on the current debugging or production needs.

This is crucial for different stages of development (e.g., development, testing, production) where you may want to log more or fewer messages.\n","\n","**Maintenance:** With logging, you can easily change the log output or format without modifying the code itself. This makes it easier to adjust the logging behavior as needed, even in a deployed application.\n","\n","**Scalability:** Logging is designed to handle large volumes of log messages efficiently. It provides options for rotating log files, managing log levels across different modules, and integrating with log analysis tools.\n","\n","**Debugging:** In a real-world application, print statements used for debugging should ideally be replaced with proper logging statements. Logging allows for more structured debugging with different log levels, making it easier to identify and isolate issues.\n","\n","**Logging is a more flexible and powerful mechanism for capturing and managing log messages in a real-world application.
